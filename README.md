## Hi, my name is Renan.

I'm 25, I live in Rio de Janeiro and I'm undegraduate in Electrical Engineering. I love science, especially physics, rocket science, astronomy, also tecnology, and I'm always looking for experience and projects to contribute, not only in GitHub.

Currently I work as an analyst at [EDF Renewables](https://www.edf-re.com/)

To know more about me check out my personal [**website**](https://renanlarrieu.github.io/)

My last project was to develop a State Machine and make MonteCarlo Simulations to estimate Outage time for Power Transformers of the [Eletrobras](https://eletrobras.com/en/Paginas/Home.aspx) Group.

**renanlarrieu/renanlarrieu** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on power electronics and university rocket telemetry projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use VIVADO HLS to generate IP's and do real time simulation.
- ðŸ‘¯ Now I'm not looking to collaborate in any project.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with FPGA designs.
- ðŸ’¬ I love to talk about rocket science, rick and morty and rock.
